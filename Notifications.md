‚è∫ Detailed Overview of Notification System Implementation

  Core Components Added

  1. NotificationManager.swift
    - Created a singleton class to centralize notification handling
    - Connects with Apple's UserNotifications framework
    - Provides permission and scheduling controls
    - Handles notification categorization and actions
  2. Database Support
    - Created DatabaseResetUtility.swift to handle migration issues
    - Enhanced model container initialization to recover from errors
    - Added schema versioning support for future migrations
  3. Settings Integration
    - Extended SettingsManager.swift with notification preferences
    - Added persistence for notification settings
    - Implemented real-time notification updating based on setting changes
  4. UI Components
    - Added notification settings UI in SettingsView.swift
    - Created test notification functionality
    - Added links to system notification settings

  Notification Features Implemented

  1. Task Notifications
    - Daily notifications based on task's scheduled time
    - Grouped notifications for required vs. suggested tasks
    - Custom notification body with task details
    - Actionable notifications to complete tasks directly
  2. Completion Feedback
    - Congratulatory notification when all required tasks are completed
    - Automatic removal of notifications for completed tasks
    - Task completion directly from notification actions
  3. User Preference Controls
    - Toggle notifications for required vs. suggested tasks
    - Default reminder time setting for tasks without specific times
    - System integration with macOS notification settings
    - Test notification feature to verify setup
  4. AppDelegate Integration
    - UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate implementation
    - Proper MainActor handling for thread safety
    - Connecting app responses to notification actions
    - Lifecycle management for notification permissions

  Technical Highlights

  1. Permission Handling
    - Request user authorization for notifications
    - Handle different permission states
    - Graceful degradation when permissions not granted
    - Links to system settings for managing permissions
  2. Notification Categories & Actions
    - Created task category with "Complete" action
    - Set up action handlers to respond to notification interactions
    - Integrated with app's navigation flow
  3. SwiftData Integration
    - Task ID preservation in notification userInfo
    - Finding and updating tasks based on notification data
    - Thread-safe task completion from notification actions
    - Recovery from database migration errors
  4. Thread Safety & Performance
    - Proper use of MainActor annotations
    - Background processing for database operations
    - Asynchronous notification scheduling
    - Low memory footprint through efficient notification management

  File Modifications Overview

  1. Added Files:
    - NotificationManager.swift: Core notification functionality
    - DatabaseResetUtility.swift: Database migration support
  2. Modified Files:
    - AppDelegate.swift: Added notification handling and delegates
    - SettingsManager.swift: Added notification preferences
    - SettingsView.swift: Added notification UI settings
    - DailyApp.swift: Enhanced model container with error recovery
    - Task.swift: Updated to work with notification system

  This notification system provides a complete solution for task reminders with deep
  integration into the app's existing architecture. It supports both scheduled and general
  notifications, handles user preferences, and provides a robust user experience with direct
   action support.
